---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

strtok() typically uses an internal buffer to store the states (where we 
are within the string last time) and is thus not thread-safe.

strtok_r() takes a third arguments to determine the place within the string 
to go on searching tokens, and thus works in multi-thread systems like Pintos.

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

In our implementation, each process maintains its own list of open files in 
an array of length 128. While the first 2 elements are intentionally left
NULL for STDIN_FILENO and STDOUT_FILENO, each subsequent array index is used
as a file descriptor corresponding to the open file stored in this array 
element. When opening a file we search in the array to find a vacancy, store
the pointer to file_info structure there, and return the index as file 
descriptor. And when closing a file we can go directly according to file 
descriptor (index in array) to find the file_info structure and close it.

This way file descritpors are unique just within a single process.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> there any special cases?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

In our implementation, each process maintains its own list of open files in 
an array of length 128. While the first 2 elements are intentionally left
NULL for STDIN_FILENO and STDOUT_FILENO, each subsequent array index is used
as a file descriptor corresponding to the open file stored in this array 
element. When opening a file we search in the array to find a vacancy, store 
the pointer to file_info structure there, and return the index as file 
descriptor. And when closing a file we can go directly according to file 
descriptor (index in array) to find the file_info structure and close it.

The main advantages of our design for file descriptors lie in the overall
speed performance. Our implemention gives O(n) time complexity for 
allocating file descriptors when opening files, while O(1) time complexity 
for all subsequent query operations in any syscall involving file descriptors.

The disadvantages of our design could be that the number of open files 
allowed for each process is limited, or that when the number of open files is
small, it wastes memory space. We have considered these short-comings and
understood we can solve them by using dynamic strctures such as list. It is 
our choice to favor speed that we choose the design with array and file 
descriptor as index in the array.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
